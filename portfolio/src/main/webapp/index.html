      <h1>Sarah Adebabay's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Sarah Adebabay. I am currently at a rising fourth year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Computer Science and Education. </p>
      <p>Growing up as the eldest daughter of two Ethiopian-American immigrants, I have always seen the world in relation to the people around me. Unconsciously, I consider the well-being of others as I make decisions. Whether it is my family, friends, or strangers, I am always willing to lend a hand to others, and I think it has to do with the values that my parents instilled in me. As young teenagers, my parents fled Ethiopia to build a safer and prosperous life for future generations. Working minimum wage jobs, my parents sacrificed college educations to support me, my sister, and my family in Ethiopia.</p>

      <h1>Past Projects</h1>
      <h2>Penny</h2>
      <p>A financial planning app focused on helping youth (middle school to college) create realistic goals for buying products, saving for college, and/or retirement to teach financial literacy at a young age. For example kids can create detailed financial plans for purchasing a car, Xbox, phone, etc. Links with a user's or user's parent's bank account for automatic or manual money transferring into the app to save for a goal. Parent's can monitor their child's account and set up an allowance if wanted. Financial plans update as preferences and details change and goals can be cancelled, returning money as needed. Rewards are given for meeting goals and reaching financial literacy milestones (giftcards, discounts, badges, etc.).</p>
